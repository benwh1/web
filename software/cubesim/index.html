<font size=5>How to use:</font><br>
<font size=4>
Download the program, extract everything into a new folder and run it. If you are updating from a previous version, move your old data (images, save, solves, videos, projections.txt, settings.dat) to the new folder.<br>
Doesn't work? <a href='https://github.com/benwh1/cubesim'>Compile it yourself</a>.

<hr>

Press <b>W</b> to open the settings window. All controls are customizable from there.<br><br>

To use projections (default keys 0-9), make a file in the same folder as the program called <b>projections.txt</b>. A projection is a 2x3 matrix, written in the file as a comma-separated list of 6 floating point numbers. Some useful projections to try are:<br>
<pre>1,0,0,0,0,1
1,0.3,0,0,0.3,1</pre>

To use the replay recorder, you must install <a href='https://ffmpeg.org/'>FFmpeg</a> and add it to your PATH environment variable (<a href=https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/>guide for Windows</a>). Open the replay recorder window after a solve is complete to use it.
